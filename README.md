## About the Project

Hi, I'm Matheus ðŸ‘‹<br>
This project was created to put into practice concepts learned in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
The goal was to build an interactive and styled carousel with rotating animations to enhance user experience and explore advanced transition techniques.

> This project was developed as an exercise to train skills in animations, interactivity, and responsive design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
